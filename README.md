## 2. Email Communication

### Intention

* To write professional emails.
* To keep email short and crisp.
* Using bullet points to cut out fluff and do precise communication.
* Otherwise using complete sentences.
* Express one's needs in writing.
* Understanding and upholding the receiver's need while sender crafts the message.
* To keep a list of email templates ready to be used in future situations.

Please go through the first video (36:11 minutes) very carefully. This contains all the relevant information.

[Email Communication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU2zs0J58vA) - 36:11 minutes

In the interactive session, I would like to focus on email reviews. You have to send 6 emails to my email id before the session. Please look at the bottom section of this email for instructions.


#### Bullet Points

Go through these two links on bullet points:

* [Improve Email productivity with Bullet Points](https://www.getorganizedwizard.com/blog/2010/11/improve-email-productivity-with-bullet-points/)
* [Best practices for Bullet Points](https://www.businesswritingblog.com/business_writing/2005/12/the_best_of_bul.html)

Use bullet points for conveying information. They need not be grammatically correct.

Don't say: I completed writing Tasks controller.
Say: Completed Tasks controller.

Use complete sentences when writing down conversational communication. Like requesting for access or requesting leaves.

#### Email Signature

Add signature to your gmail (3:20 minutes):
[Add signature to Gmail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4k77veybI0)

Add Signature to Migadu at
Settings > Accounts > Edit your mountblue.tech Identity (default)

* Add your full name.
* In email signature, write your full name and mobile phone number.

#### Grammarly

Install [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) plugin in your browser.

#### Basic Rules

Follow basic English language rules:

* Use active voice
* Use simple English
* No random commas or full stops. Be consistent. Stick to your writing style.
* No space before punctuation. Single space before punctuation.
* Capitalisation only in proper nouns, start of sentence or  abbreviation
* Use proper bullet point. Use the button in the email editor.
* Don't use extra sentences. Keep emails short and crisp.
* If you are making a request or asking for clarification, ask a clear direct question.
* No random bold. Bold has to be used. Not more than 3 or 4 percent of the mail should be bold.
* No all caps.
* Good rule of thumb
 - One third for planning
 - One third for writing
 - One third for reviewing
* If you have 9 minutes, spent 3 minutes each
* Always spellcheck
* While writing emails, be aware of principles of assertive communication - understanding your needs, communicating about them while being in harmony with the needs of the other person.
